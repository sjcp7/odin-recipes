		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This is a passion-fruit flavoured mousse of brazilian origin. Contrary to most mousse variations, this one is moderately sour, for those who don't like desserts that are too sweet.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 passion fruits</li>
			<li>1 tbsp of white sugar</li>
			<li>1 (14 ounce) can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
			<li>2 cups of cream</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.</li>
			<li>In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
		</ol>
